# Unit-4-game

This game was created using HTML, css, Bootstrap and JavaScript.  It is a basic click based game.  When the user navigates to the game, there will be a random number that is shown on the screen.  The user will then be able to click on four images, and each image will hold a random number.  When the user clicks on the image, a random number will be shown in the total score area of the game.  The user will continue to click the images until they either match the random number or they go over the random number.  If the user wins a win will be added to the win column and if the use loses then a loss will be added to the loss column.  The game will then restart with a new random number and four new image values.  The user wins the game when they win five games and the game is over when there are five losses.  After five games are won or lost, everything is reset including the win and loss column.
